Plot extends 30 m to either side of stream. The narrow riparian strip (IO-20 m wide) is bordered by residential property for the lower 100 m and by fallow fig/ walnut orchard for an additional 250 m. The remaining 1930 m grades away from the stream into mostly undisturbed native bay-oak woodland, which comprises much of the plot. There is one residence and several small water treatment buildings above the orchard and a dirt road follows the creek through about half of the plot. Stream fiow is regulated by a IOU-year old darn upstream of the plot and some How is present at all times. A quantitative vegetation survey was conducted following a modified version of the method described by James and Shugart (1970. Aud.Field Notes 242727-736). Tree diameters (26 cm; n = 410) were measured in 30 evenly spaced 0.04 ha (60 X 6.6 m) rectangles situated perpendicularly to the stream fiow. Total tree density 342/ha, total basal area 99 mZ/ha. Species comprising 96% of total trees [figures after each give trees/ ha, relative density (%), relative dominance ('70) and frequency, respectively]: California Bay 117, 34, 26, 18; Coast Live Oak 75, 22, 26, 21; California Buckeye 38, 11, 3, 14; White Alder 27, 8, 16, 13; Bigleaf Maple 20,6, 17, 13; willow 18, 5, 2.5, 10; walnut 13, 4, 1.5, 2; dead trees 7, 2, 1, 4; Blue Elderberry 7, 2, 0.5, 5; Valley Oak 5, 1, 4, 2; Oregon Ash 5, 1, 1, 3.

Shrub cover was measured by line-intercept along 60 m transects at each of 30 sampling stations. Approximate total shrub cover 30%. Shrubs by species [figures after each give % coverage of total area and frequency, respectively]: White-stemmed Raspberry 8, 28; willow 4, 5; California Wild Grape 3.5, 19; Poison Oak 3, 16; Toyon 2.5, 10; French Broom 2, 6; Common Snowberry 1.5, 7; Winter Currant 1, 1; Chain Fern 1, 10; California Bay 1, 9; Chaparral Broom 1, 7; Bush Monkeyflower 0.5, 5; Bracken 0.5, 7; California Buckeye 0.5, 6; Spice Bush 0.5, 6; others 1.5, -.

The plot had never been plowed for agriculture because the soil was too wet; however, it was periodically grazed until 1920 and logged until 1953. The landscape surrounding the sanctuary was developed for agriculture starting in the late 18th century and reached maximum development in the late 19th century.

A description of the current vegetation composition has been adapted from a 1985 study by the Natural Resources Group of NYC Parks Dept. The plot is deciduous forest, but the vegetational composition of patches within the plot vary with past land uses. A large area where there was once an elaborate garden still retains many non-native plants today. The most common plants given roughly in order of dominance for the largest patches within the plot are listed as follows: very mature Red, White, and Black oaks, blackberry, Wild Geranium, rich herbaceous diversity and scattered Day-lily patches that date back to 1885 or older (4.01 ha); oaks, American Sycamore, Tuliptree, other natives and non-natives (e.g., Day-lily) planted on old estate, often dense shrubs (1.89 ha); mature Red Oak, White Oak, Tuliptree, Smooth Sumac, Sassafras, Black Birch, goldenrod, dogbanes, very open canopy (1.50 ha); Black Locust, Black Cherry, dense ground cover, formerly estate or pasture (1.36 ha). About 1174 m of trails, run through the plot. Some signs of vanished buildings still remain. The plot has also been affected by fire. Fires have often been set in spring in the large phragmites stand W of plot and occasionally have spread into plot. A fire on 30 March 1987 burned 3.06 ha of N and W plot. A fire break was cut in 1989 along E edge of phragmites adjacent to forest to reduce fire intrusion into the plot. In some areas, fires have greatly suppressed oak and other woody regeneration. Although shrubs (e.g., Viburnum) are not spreading, blackberry has been promoted nearly throughout."

Ecological succession over 86 years has produced a nearly mature riparian deciduous forest on the site, now protected by the Toledo Area Metroparks. The vegetation study was conducted in early August, 1988, a year before bird censuses were initiated. Since the plot is long and narrow, transects were run at right angles to the long axis of the plot at 100-m intervals. There were 16 transects in all; the length of each was 30 m. All trees within 10 m and all shrubs/ saplings within 5 m of each transect were counted and the relative abundance of each species recorded as a percentage of the total number of trees and shrubs/saplings counted. Herbaceous vegetation cover was determined by estimating the percent cover of each species in a l-m2 circle located every 6 m along each transect. Thus, there were 5 sample circles per transect, and 80 (5 X 16) sample Circles in all. Sometimes the sum of the percent cover values exceeded 100% for a circle because of vertical overlap of the leaves of different species. When this occurred the percentages were reduced proportionally to bring the sum for each circle down to 100%. Percent cover values for each species were summed over all sample circles and divided by 80; thus data for all 3 layers of vegetation may be considered to express percent relative abundances. Relative abundance (70) is given after each species name: (trees 2 15 cm) Boxelder, 13.8; American Basswood, 11.9; Hackberry, 10.8; Black Walnut, 9.7; Eastern Cottonwood, 9.0; American Elm, 8.8; Eastern Redbud, 6.8; Honeylocust, 6.6; Green Ash, 6.6; hawthorn, 3.4; Sycamore, 2.2; Ohio Buckeye, 1.8; Black Ash, 1.7; 11 other species, 6.8.

Railroad cuts bordering the western edge have contributed to erosion gullies. A sewage pumping station, occupying ca 0.1 ha, lies in the southern section of the plot. The following description of the vegetation was adapted from a 1989 study by the Natural Resources Group of NYC Department of Parks and Recreation. Species are listed in approximate order of dominance. The southern section of the plot (2.0 ha) contains several small vine communities of blackberry, porcelainberry, Japenese Hops, and wild grape, all under 1.5 m. Forest in this portion of the plot (1.6 ha) is dominated by Red Oak, Black Locust, and Tuliptree (canopy height ca 9 m), with an understory composed of Black Birch, Mulberry, and Sassafras. The middle portion of the plot (3.3 ha) contains a mixture of woodland dominated by Black Oak, Red Oak, and Black Locust (canopy height ca 9 m), and shrubby field dominated by Porcelainberry and Multifiora Rose. The woodland understory in this section is dominated by honeysuckle and bittersweet. The northern section of the plot (3.5 ha) is dominated by oak woodland and closed-canopy forest.

The forest is second growth oak and Red Maple that grew in after farm land was abandoned about 60 yr ago. The plot is a portion of a 27 ha reserve owned by the University of Rhode Island, and situated amidst a landscape dominated by residential development. Much of the remainder of the forest consists of a Red Pine plantation. Additional plantings of non-native trees occur on the plot, the largest being a 0.3 ha Red Pine planting. Red Maple occurs mostly as a subcanopy or as smaller sized trees. Substantial numbers of oaks, in a band across the center of the plot have been killed by Gypsy Moths, resulting in a relatively open canopy. Additional canopy openings occur at two small ponds on the W side of the plot. These kettleholes both contained water during the census period. The understory is largely dominated by dense growth of bullbrier (Smilax sp.). A trail bisects the plot from the center of its N boundary to the SW corner. A quantitative vegetation survey following the method described by EC. James and H.H. Shugart, Jr. (1970. Aud.

Eight transects were established at 100-m intervals, and a 0.5 m2 quadrat sample was taken at 10-m intervals along each transect.

Shrub species in order of total abundance: wild red raspberry 15,000 stems <0.5 m, 6800 stems 0.5-1 m, 300 stems 1-2 m, 0 stems >2 m; water-willow 2800, 400, 0, 0; riverbank grape 800, 800, 300, 0; buttonbush 0, 200, 500, 100; sweetbrier 0, 0, 400, 0; tamarack 0, 0, 0, 100. Significant changes from 1991 include an increase in the abundance of wild red raspberry (from 11,100 to 22,100 stems/ ha), and a decrease in the abundance of water-Willow (10,200 to 3200). This decrease in water-willow can be partly accounted for by seasonal differences; in 1993 the stems were counted earlier in a cooler year than in 1991. Changes of 5% or more between 1992 and 1993 in the mean estimated cover for ground layer species, based on 10, 1x1 m quadrats include a 94% increase in tussock sedge, and large increases in the cover of mosses and lichens."
